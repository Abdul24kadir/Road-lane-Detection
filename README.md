# Road Lane Detection Project

## Introduction
This repository contains the code and resources for Task 1 of the virtual internship by TopperWorld. In this project, I utilized data science techniques along with computer vision to develop a road lane detection system.

## About the Project
The main goal of this project is to detect and mark lane boundaries on the road using computer vision techniques. This is a crucial step in various applications such as autonomous driving, advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), and video surveillance.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library)
- Jupyter notebook
- required libraries:Numpy,pandas,matlplotlib and ML libraries

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the main script `Road_lane_detection.py` to execute the road lane detection algorithm.
   ```bash
   python lane_detection.py
   ```
